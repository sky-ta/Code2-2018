Description:
1. Pong Game Original Remix:
	- This is a simple iteration of the pong game
	- Move left paddle with 'W' and 'S'key
	- Move right paddle with 'UP' and 'DOWN' key
2. Pong Game, My Remix:
	- This is the new remix of the pong game, MUCH HARDER!
	- In this iteration, the color of the screen change everytime a player scored
	- Color of pong ball basically blends to the background
	- The paddles flashes color, create distraction to player
	- Require a lot more focus!!
